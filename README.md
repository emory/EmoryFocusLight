# EmoryFocusLight

This is a light and breezy OmniFocus theme with some light color syntaxing for status of items.  I also use font size on next actions, blocked actions, over/due actions and think in tandem with color this makes some things more obvious and pop when I'm doing my planning.  

The font I use in this style is [Segoe UI](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=331), it also looks good (my opinion) with Ubuntu, Droid Sans, Geneva, but maybe you prefer Comic Sans.
